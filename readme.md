This is just a test of mine. Use at your own risk. Works best with a [floating summernote](https://www.wondercms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1252) editor.

## How to install

1. Login to your website.
1. Go to Settings >> Themes & Plugins.
1. Select `Theme` and paste the following url in the input field:
1. Enable the theme in the General section. 

## Sample data

The sample-database.js contains the same HTML from the demo website. Uses /loginURL as login url and 'admin' as password.

## Features

The theme adds a parallax header to each page. You can edit the title and subtitle in the header just by clicking on it.
This works the best with the summernote plugin, but as a [floating editor](https://www.wondercms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1252).

You can set a background by uploding a file using the page title as the filename. Any extention works, but I reccomend using jpeg files.

Example:

home.jpg gets used as the homepage background
home.png gets used as the homepage background
example.webp gets used as the background for the page `/example`
